/**
 * Register a tap handler that works on both touch and non-touch devices.
 *
 * ## Why module-level touchFired (not per-element)
 *
 * On touch devices, after touchend fires, the browser synthesises a click
 * ~4ms later at the same coordinates. When a touchend handler opens an
 * overlay (higher z-index) at those coordinates, the synthesised click
 * hit-tests against the overlay instead of the original button — closing
 * it immediately. A per-element guard only prevents double-fire on the
 * SAME element; module-level state prevents cross-element synthesised clicks.
 *
 * ## Why not preventDefault() on touchend
 *
 * The W3C Touch Events spec says preventDefault() on touchend suppresses
 * synthesised mouse events — the "correct" solution. But it was removed
 * (d40fa46) because without synthesised mousedown, focus stays on the
 * terminal textarea and Android re-shows the keyboard when toolbar buttons
 * are pressed. Restoring it would require blur() + reworking keyboard state
 * preservation (isKeyboardOpen/conditionalFocus) across 11 call sites.
 *
 * ## Why not Pointer Events (pointerup)
 *
 * preventDefault() on pointerup does NOT suppress compatibility mouse
 * events per the Pointer Events spec. The browser still synthesises
 * mousedown/mouseup/click from the underlying touch events.
